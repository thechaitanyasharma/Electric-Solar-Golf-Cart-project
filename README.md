# 🏎️ Electric Solar Golf Cart: A Sustainable Mobility Prototype
### Full-Scale Engineering, Fabrication, and System Integration Portfolio
**Project Date:** September 18, 2025 | **Location:** IILM University, Greater Noida

---

## 📝 Executive Summary
This project represents the complete design, development, and in-house fabrication of an **8-seater solar-assisted electric vehicle (EV)**. What began as a conceptual sketch was transformed into a fully operational prototype through rigorous interdisciplinary engineering. 

The project showcases a synthesis of **Mechanical Design**, **Electrical System Integration**, **Materials Science**, and **Additive Manufacturing**. By leveraging a 250W solar array and a 3kW BLDC motor, the team successfully created a zero-emission transport solution tailored for campus-scale mobility.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture & Methodology

The development process was divided into four critical engineering phases:

### 1. Mechanical Fabrication & Chassis Design
The foundation of the vehicle is a custom-welded steel chassis. Unlike pre-manufactured frames, this was built from scratch in the university workshop.
* **Structural Integrity:** Precisely calculated load-bearing points to support 8 passengers plus the battery weight.
* **Carpentry & Ergonomics:** Custom woodwork was utilized for the body and seating system, balanced for weight distribution.
* **Steering & Suspension:** Integrated a manual steering rack and leaf-spring suspension to handle the increased torque of the electric motor.



### 2. Electrical Powertrain Integration
The heart of the vehicle is a 48V high-torque system.
* **Motor Control:** The 3kW BLDC motor is managed by a programmable controller, optimized for smooth acceleration curves and regenerative braking potential.
* **Battery Management:** The 100Ah Li-ion pack provides high energy density compared to traditional lead-acid batteries, significantly reducing the vehicle's curb weight.
* **Wiring Architecture:** Industrial-grade looms were designed to separate high-voltage traction power from low-voltage auxiliary systems (lights/dash).

### 3. Solar Energy Harvesting (The Green Edge)
To extend the range and promote sustainability, a solar canopy was integrated.
* **Photovoltaic Array:** 250W panels mounted on the roof.
* **MPPT Efficiency:** Used an MPPT controller to ensure the batteries receive a constant charge even in fluctuating sunlight conditions, increasing efficiency by ~20% over standard PWM controllers.

### 4. Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing)
As a specialist in 3D design, I integrated custom-manufactured parts that would otherwise require expensive tooling:
* **Custom Gear Levers:** Designed for specific ergonomic reach.
* **Indicator Switch Housing:** Integrated into the steering column.
* **Branding & Logos:** 3D printed nameplates for the "Solar Cart" identity.
* **Dashboard Switches:** Custom-fit mounts for the digital speedometer and battery level indicator.

## 📈 Design Process: From Sketch to Street

### Phase I: Conceptualization
The project started with hand sketches followed by CAD modeling in **Autodesk Fusion 360**. We performed structural analysis to ensure the frame wouldn't deflect under the weight of 8 adults.

### Phase II: The Workshop Grind
The physical fabrication involved:
* **Metal Work:** Precise cutting, grinding, and MIG/TIG welding of the frame.
* **Component Mounting:** Aligning the motor and axle for perfect power delivery.

### Phase III: System Testing & Validation
Testing was conducted in three stages:
1. **Static Test:** Battery discharge and solar charging rate validation.
2. **Dynamic Test:** Low-speed trials to check steering alignment and braking distance.
3. **Endurance Test:** Full-load trials (8 passengers) to monitor motor heat and battery depletion rates.

## 💡 Lessons Learned & Future Scope
The successful completion of this vehicle underscores the viability of student-led sustainable innovation. 
* **Key Learning:** The integration of Li-ion and Solar required precise voltage matching and thermal management.
* **Future Upgrade:** We aim to implement **IoT-based Remote Monitoring** to track battery health and GPS location in real-time.
* **Autonomous Potential:** Given the digital controller architecture, the cart is a perfect candidate for basic autonomous "follow-me" robotics integration.

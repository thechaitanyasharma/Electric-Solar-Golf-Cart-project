# ☀️ Electric Solar Golf Cart: Sustainable Campus Mobility
### An 8-Seater, Zero-Emission Prototype Built from Scratch
**Project Date:** September 18, 2025 | **Location:** IILM University, Greater Noida

---

## 📝 Project Overview
The **Electric Solar Golf Cart** is a full-scale engineering prototype designed to solve campus transportation challenges using renewable energy. This project involved the complete lifecycle of vehicle development—from initial CAD conceptualization to heavy-duty steel fabrication and electrical system integration.

The vehicle features a **48V powertrain** augmented by a **250W solar canopy**, allowing for passive charging while stationary or in motion. A key highlight of this project is the use of **Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM)** to create custom ergonomic controls and switchgear.

### 🔬 3D Printed Components
We utilized 3D printing to bypass traditional tooling costs for custom ergonomic parts:
* **Custom Gear Levers:** Optimized for driver reach.
* **Indicator Switch Housing:** Integrated into the steering column.
* **Branding:** Custom nameplates and dashboard mounts.

## 🛠️ Engineering Methodology

### 1. Mechanical Design & Fabrication
The chassis was fabricated entirely in-house using precise metal cutting, grinding, and welding. 
* **Structural Analysis:** The frame was designed to support a gross weight of 8 adults plus the 100Ah battery pack.
* **Ergonomics:** Custom carpentry was applied to the seating and bodywork to balance weight and passenger comfort.



### 2. Electrical Powertrain & Solar Integration
* **Efficiency:** The MPPT controller ensures that the Li-ion batteries receive the maximum possible wattage from the solar canopy.
* **Performance:** The 3kW motor provides high torque, essential for maintaining speed with a full passenger load.

### 3. Additive Manufacturing (DfAM)
Using **Autodesk Fusion 360**, custom parts were modeled and printed to ensure a professional "OEM" fit and finish for the dashboard and control interfaces.

## 📈 Testing & Validation
The vehicle underwent a multi-stage validation process:
1. **Static Load Testing:** Verifying chassis deflection under max passenger weight.
2. **Charging Efficiency:** Measuring solar harvest rates in various weather conditions.
3. **Dynamic Performance:** Testing braking distance and turning radius for campus safety standards.
